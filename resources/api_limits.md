# API Calling Limits

The API has default calling limits as shown below. These limits are meant to protect BEAâ€™s API and webserver
infrastructure from activity that may be detrimental to that infrastructure and/or unfairly impede other API users.

- 1000 API calls per minute, and/or
- 30 errors per minute, and/or
- 200 MB (raw data) per minute.

Any user that exceeds the above calling limits will receive an explanatory error message for each API call until
the per-minute cause has expired. The best way to avoid such errors is to design your application to call the API
within these limits, e.g., programmatically regulate the frequency/size of API calls.
